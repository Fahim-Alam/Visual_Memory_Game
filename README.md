Visual Memory Game Directions:
At Every level, a number of tiles will flash green for few seconds. Memorize them, and pick them again after the tiles are reset.
Levels get progressively more difficult.


Earn points by correctly selecting the right tiles. Likewise, points will be deducted if you select the wrong tiles.
